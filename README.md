# Gravity Empire Mod PvP Duel Server

Welcome to the Gravity Empire Mod PvP Duel Server README!

This repository hosts the configuration files and setup instructions for the Gravity Empire mod running on a Minecraft server. This server is specifically designed for full PvP battles and duels, featuring a variety of plugins to enhance gameplay and ensure stability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Minecraft Java Edition installed on your computer.
- Basic knowledge of running a Minecraft server.

### Setup Instructions
1. Download the latest release of the Gravity Empire mod and server files from the repository.
2. Install a compatible version of Minecraft Server (version 1.9) on your hosting provider or local machine.
3. Configure the server properties according to your preferences, such as server name, max players, and world settings.
4. Start the server using the appropriate startup command for your operating system. For Windows users, run the `start.bat` file, where you can set the RAM size by editing the file. For other operating systems, use the equivalent startup command.
5. Once the server is running, players can join using the server IP address.

### *Note* Some of the maps dosent have spawns or some of the maps Corrupted
### This means you need [Third-Party Program](https://github.com/mcedit/mcedit2) to find where is the FullPVP or Duel Arena
*Note*: The Gravity Empire mod files and the plugins mentioned in the "Plugins Used" section are not required. You don't need to do anything with the plugin folder. However, you may need to change the language configuration from Hungarian to English within the mod configuration files for the optimal gameplay experience. You can do this by modifying the language configuration settings yourself, as the original developer was too lazy to do it.

### Note
Please be aware that this server is a stopped project from 2021, and the mod is considered half done. As a result, we cannot provide any support for issues encountered while using it.

If you use our mod and successfully set up a server, feel free to reach out to us on Instagram or Discord! We'd be happy to explore your finished and set up server.
